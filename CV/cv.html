    		<h2>About Me</h2>
    		<div id="personal">
    			<p>I'm 34 years old, originally from Reading, UK and now live the beautiful surrounds of the French Alps in the world famous resort of <em>Meribel</em>. As you would expect from someone who has chosen to live the mountains I am an avid <strong>Skier, Snowboarder and Mountain Biker.</strong> Alongside these activities, I also enjoy <strong>reading</strong> historical fiction, challenging myself to <strong>code</strong> simple websites and programmes, and <strong>travelling</strong> to foreign countries to experience different cultures.</p>

    		<div class="job card">
    			<h3>Business Development Manager</h3>
    			<h4><a href="https://european-pubs.com" target="_blank">European Pubs Limited</a> 01-02-2019 to present</h4>
	    		<p>As part of the <strong>senior management</strong> team I am involved in all high level decisions, during a very turbulent time for the company. In 2019 we closed two of our venues as we moved into a larger space that also offered a hotel as part of our portfolio, before then leading into the COVID-19 pandemic through 2020 and 2021. During this time Brexit was also finalised which resulted in European Pubs having to adjust its recruiting strategy.</p>
	    		<p>My position had originally been created to focus on growing European Pubs with a target valuation of 10m€ with 15 venues by 2025. Understandably due to the reasons mentioned above those plans and targets were adjusted and my focus became much more <strong>strategic</strong> and internal as we navigated these years.</p>
	    		<p>Whilst I was only able to deliver the company growth of trading two venues with a gross revenue of approximately 1m€ to single building venue with a gross revenue of 2m€, I ensured the company had <em>scaleable</em> practices in place to enable further growth. This took place in the following ways</p>
	    		<ul>
	    			<li>Moved bookkeeping and accounting system to the cloud allowing wider access amongst stakeholders</li>
	    			<li>Implemented dedicated HR and Staff Scheduling system</li>
	    			<li>Implemented dedicated Stock and Invetory Management System</li>
	    			<li>Oversaw switch between POS systems to a more user friendly and multiple venue focused service</li>
	    			<li>Reviewed and analysed financials of potential companies for future acquirement</li>
	    		</ul>
