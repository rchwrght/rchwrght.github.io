		<p>Having worked 10 years in the Service Industry in the French Alps,
			I decided that I wanted to start looking for something new to do with my life. Having always had an
			interest in Coding and Programming when I was younger, I have decided to turn back to this
			interest and see if there is something there.
		<br/><br/>So here I am trying to do something new and create something out of nothing on this GitHub, so that one day I can show 			off what I have learnt and change jobs.
