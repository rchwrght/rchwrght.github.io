	<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Having worked 10 years in the Service Industry in the French 			Alps, I decided that I wanted to start looking for something new to 			do with my 	life. Having always had an interest in Coding and 				Programming when I was younger, I have decided to turn back to this 			interest and see if there is something there.
		<br/><br/>So here I am trying to do something new and create 				something out of nothing on this GitHub, so that one day I can show 			off what I have learnt and change jobs.
