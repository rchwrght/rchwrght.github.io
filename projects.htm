			<h2>Unity Development Course by GameDev.tv</h2>
		</div>
		<p>This is a course offered over on Udemy (<a href=https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/overview>Click Here</a>) that I found.
			After having completed all the HTML, CSS and JS courses on Codecademy I had decided I wanted to look further into Game Development.
		 	<br /> <br />This course comes with endless excellent reviews and so I decided to take the plunge. It has formed the basis of an introduction
			to the game engine Unity and comprehensive introduction to the language C#.

		<p>Codecademy was a free resource recommended to me as a starting point for my journey into coding. It has the potential to upgrade to the Pro package
		but this was something I was told to ignore as there are better resources available for that level of education.
	<br/><br/>This proved to be a useful place to learn basic HTML, CSS, JS and the libray JQuery as well as an introduction to git. All things that I am
		practicing and using to build this website step by step. It forewarned me the chaos that can ensue in coding and I am learning that now as I constantly
		change and update parts of this site, but then I feel this is the best learning practice as I can consolidate finalised code and tidy it up to create
		a library of re-usable code for the future.</p>
