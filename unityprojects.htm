			<h2>Bowl Master</h2>
			<p>Currently working on a simple touch and drag Bowling game, that is require learning to work within a 3D space (our first 3D game) </br>
			This has also included some larger scale challenges within the course such as being left to develop our own scoring system (not that easy with bowling)</br>
			Below I have added a picture (taken using <a href="http://instaco.de/">InstaCode</a>) as a sample of what is making the game work seeing as this project will be too large to be hosted on this website.</p>

			<h2>Glitch Garden</h2>
			<p>For this project we focused on building to a mobile platform and ensuring that we could adapt to each respective aspect ratio. <br/>
					We were also introduced into a currency system and the Unity animation controller so we could start embellishing the games with some polish.</p>

			<h2>Number Wizard - Playable</h2>
			<p>The very first Unity game made, just a simple guess the number game.<br />Tweaks I made to the course was to randomise the guess the computer makes so it feels more natural.</p>
